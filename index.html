    <h1>Third Place is better than no place at all.</h1>
    <h2>If you're looking at this, you're invited to a private backyard musical event.</h2>
    <h3>What's the deal?</h3>

    <p>I'm opening up my hoome every couple months to what will, in essence, be a bunch of strangers to me. If you're receiving this invite, you're the first group to enter the space and are the responsible barrier of entry. You're allowed to share this with your friends, those </p>

    <h3>What?</h3>
    <p>We'll be taking a break every couple months. Relax, be kind. Make music, make friends, share.</p>
    <p>I'm hosting the first, *smalllll* show here.</p>


    <h3>Where?</h3>
    <p>My back yard.</p>

    <address>
      3144 Carlyle St.
      Los Angeles 90065
    </address>

    <p><strong>Street parking is available.</strong> It's a very steep hill, so be sure to turn your wheels away from the curb if you're facing up, or toward the curb if you're facing down the hill. You won't thank me for your car being intact when you leave, but you also won't thank yourself if you find it at the bottom of the hill.</p>
