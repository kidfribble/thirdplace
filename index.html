      <h1>A Third Place</h1>
      <h2>If you're reading at this, you're invited to a special private event. It's a performance, a potluck, a tasting, and a jam session rolled into one low-key evening.</h2>

        <h3>What's A Third Place?</h3>

        <p>It's a break from the routine. Let's get out of our homes and out of our offices to be among talented friends, artists, and kind neighbors. I'm opening up my home every couple months to what will, in essence, be a musical parenthesis on our daily lives. I'm excited to welcome you to my space, and <strong>you're encouraged to invite a friend or two</strong>. Use your best judgement to keep this well-mannered, please.</p>
        <p>RSVP with guest count over text: <a href="tel:+14133416660‬">(413) 341-6660‬</a> Careful with that number.</p>

        <h3>First, the music.</h3>
        <p>Sets will be performed by Flip, <a href="https://katherineevansmusic.com/">Katherine Evans</a>, and <a href="http://www.careyclayton.com/">Carey Clayton</a>. We're expecting about 15-20 minutes of music to be performed by each artist. (We will start when we're ready and finish when we're done)</p>
        <p>Donations are encouraged: Venmo (link comin') or cash in the donations jar at the event.</p>

        <h3>What should I bring?</h3>

        <p>A well-behaved dog or two is cool too.</p>

        <h3>Anything I should leave home?</h3>

        <p>Please leave party-time substances at your own home! Leave your stress at home, too. While you're here, you're responsible to keep the event safe and enjoyable for everyone (and my neighbors.)</p>

        <h3>Where is it?</h3>
        <p><strong>Street parking is available.</strong> It's a very steep hill, so be sure to turn your wheels away from the curb if you're facing up, or toward the curb if you're facing down the hill. You won't thank me for your car being intact when you leave, but you also won't thank yourself if you find it at the bottom of the hill.</p>
